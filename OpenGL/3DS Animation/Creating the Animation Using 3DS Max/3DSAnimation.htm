		<p>This page is designed to be an aid for creating animation in 3D Studio 
			Max.&nbsp; Many of you might already know how to model and set key frames in 
			Max, but I am going to show you how to make it work so it animates correctly in 
			the 3DS Animation Tutorial created by <a href="http://www.GameTutorials.com">www.GameTutorials.com</a>.&nbsp; 
			This type of animation is just the beginning before you move into bone 
			animation.&nbsp; There are a lot of restrictions and loss of true motion when 
			doing it this way.&nbsp; Basically, you are just creating objects and then 
			translating, scaling or rotation them with key frames.&nbsp; That means you can 
			not use bones to give the object of character life like motion.&nbsp; This is 
			how it was done before skeletal animation was used in the older games.<br>
		</p>
		<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/TheBasicsTitle.jpg" align="center" width="221" height="38"><br>
		</p>
		<p>Let me start by saying that the version of max that we will be using is <b>3D Studio 
				Max 3.0</b>.&nbsp; The differences between 3 and 4 aren't big enough to max 
			2 separate versions of this tutorial.&nbsp; If you are using 2.5 and below it 
			might be a tad bit different, but if you already know 3DS Max it shouldn't be a 
			problem.&nbsp; Below you can see 3D Studio Max open with the 4 default views (<b>Figure 
				1.1</b>).&nbsp; We will be working with the bottom right view called the <b>perspective</b>
			view.&nbsp; If you click on that view port, then click the Min/Max Toggle 
			button <img border="0" src="images/MinMaxButton.jpg" width="25" height="25"> in 
			the bottom right it will allow you to just see the perspective view, which will 
			give you a larger window to work with. You can click the button again to return 
			to the 4 view ports.<br>
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/MaxDefault.jpg" width="640" height="480"><b><br>
				Figure 1.1<br>
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>First off, let's do a quick walk through on how to create objects in 3DS 
			max.&nbsp; Let's start by creating a simple box.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/CreateDefaults.jpg" align="right" width="182" height="245">Click 
			on the <b>Create </b>tab <img border="0" src="images/CreateTab.jpg" width="25" height="25">
			on the right.&nbsp; You should now see for some of the object types listed a 
			Box, Cone, Sphere, etc (<b>Figure 1.2</b>).&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't, make sure 
			you have the <b>Standard Primitives</b> selected from the drop down menu and 
			the <b>Geometry </b>button <img border="0" src="images/GeometryButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">
			is selected right above that.&nbsp; Click on the button that says <b>Box</b>.&nbsp; 
			A section below should appear that allows you to set the new box's attributes 
			like length, width and height, along with the amount of segments (detail) it 
			will have.&nbsp; Do not set this data yet, but first put your cursor in the <b>perspective
			</b>view port around the origin (0, 0, 0) and click, hold, then drag the mouse 
			to the right and up a bit.&nbsp; This will create the length and width of the 
			box.&nbsp; You will notice, once you let go it will then create the height 
			depending on where you move the mouse.&nbsp; If you move it up it will increase 
			the height, if you move it down, it will decrease the height.&nbsp; When you 
			found a decent height click the mouse and it&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="right"><b>Figure 1.2</b></p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/SampleBox.jpg" align="left" width="320" height="240">will 
			save your box.&nbsp; The width and height doesn't matter right now, nor the 
			position of the box because we will set the values in a second.&nbsp; The box 
			should have a random color that 3DS Max set for you (but remember this isn't a 
			material!).&nbsp; Refer to <b>Figure 1.3</b> for an example of what yours might 
			look like.&nbsp; If you look over to the right you will notice that the <b>Length</b>,
			<b>Width</b> and <b>Height</b> values reflect the box you just created.&nbsp; 
			They are most likely very crude and precise numbers.&nbsp; Let's make this a 
			cube by setting each of those values to <b>30</b>.&nbsp; Now we should have a 
			cube with a size of <b>Length</b>, <b>Width</b> and <b>Height</b> of <b>30</b>.&nbsp; 
			You might notice up above there is an option for the creation method to create 
			a cube instead of a box, but I wanted you to get comfortable with inputting 
			your own values.</p>
		<p><b>Figure 1.3</b></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>You can you use the <b>Arc Rotate</b> button <img border="0" src="images/RotateButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">
			and the <b>Zoom</b> button <img border="0" src="images/ZoomButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">
			to rotate and zoom around the world to get a better view of the object you just 
			created.&nbsp; To zoom in, you can also use the mouse wheel on your mouse if 
			you have one.&nbsp; If you notice there is a local (X, Y, Z) axis in red 
			centered at the bottom of the cube.&nbsp; That is the object's <b>Pivot Point</b>.&nbsp; 
			We will discuss later on how to change that.&nbsp; Basically, a pivot point is 
			the origin (0, 0, 0) for the object in model space.&nbsp; We are looking at 
			world space, but each object has their own model space.&nbsp; So when you 
			translate that object to (0, 0, 0) it's pivot point will be at (0, 0, 0) in 
			world space.&nbsp; Then however the object is position according to it's pivot 
			point it will then be translated.&nbsp; For instance, right now the cube's 
			pivot point is centered at the bottom of the cube.&nbsp; If we translated the 
			cube to (0, 0, 0) it would be above the origin, but centered along the X and Y 
			axis (Z is up in 3DS Max) and the pivot point would be at (0, 0, 0) in world 
			space.&nbsp; Let's say we move the pivot point to the center of the cube.&nbsp; 
			Now, if we translated the cube to (0, 0, 0) in world space the pivot point 
			would still be at (0, 0, 0), but the cube would be totally centered around the 
			origin.&nbsp; Basically, where ever the pivot point goes, the object goes and 
			keeps the same position from it.</p>
		<p>Speaking of translating, let's move the object and center it at the origin (of 
			course on top of the grid because its pivot point is at the bottom of the 
			cube).&nbsp; To do this, we want to make sure the cube is selected, then click 
			on the Translate button <img border="0" src="images/TranslateButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">.</p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/TranslateBox.jpg" align="left" width="293" height="126">Once 
			we selected this button we want to right click on it.&nbsp; This will bring up 
			a dialog box <b>(Figure 1.4)</b> that will allow us to numerically translate 
			the object to a specific (x, y, z).&nbsp; Type in <b>0</b> for the <b>X Y</b> and
			<b>Z</b> <b>Absolute:World</b> values.&nbsp; You should see that your cube is 
			now centered around the origin but on top of the grid.<br>
			<br>
			<b>
				<br>
				Figure 1.4</b></p>
		<p align="left">If you don't want to type in where you want the box to go, you can 
			select the Translate button and click and drag the box to where you want.&nbsp; 
			You can restrict the movement along certain axis' by clicking on one of the 
			Restrict buttons <img border="0" src="images/RestrictButtons.jpg" width="97" height="32">.&nbsp; 
			On the right of those there is also a button menu to choose multiple 
			axis's.&nbsp; These work the same for rotations too.&nbsp; Try playing around 
			with some of the other shapes besides boxes and get comfortable with moving 
			them around.&nbsp; Before we go on, let's assign a material to our 
			object.&nbsp; I won't go into how to put a texture on the object here, but I 
			will give you the <i>jist</i> of how to do it.&nbsp; If you hit '<b>m</b>' it 
			will bring up the Material Editor (<b>Figure 1.5</b>).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="images/MaterialEditor.jpg" align="right" width="366" height="307">Select 
			a color from the material editor.&nbsp; Then click again and drag the material 
			onto the object.&nbsp; Now the object will have that color mapped on it.&nbsp; 
			You should at least have a color material on all of your objects, otherwise 
			they will appear gray in the 3DS Loader.&nbsp; If you want to apply a texture 
			map, I will quickly explain how.&nbsp; Click on the gray button next to the 
			diffuse color in the editor.&nbsp; A dialog box should come up with some 
			options for a map, double click the bitmap option.&nbsp; It will then allow you 
			to choose the file that will be the texture map.&nbsp; After you choose the 
			file you should see the texture mapped around the color sphere you had selected 
			in the material editor (usually the first one).&nbsp; Now, click and drag that 
			texture onto the object.&nbsp; Then, you will need to click the <b>Show Map In View 
				Port</b> button <img border="0" src="images/ShowTexture.jpg" width="25" height="25">.&nbsp; 
			This will display the texture map in your perspective view port.&nbsp; You can 
			then from there apply a <b>UVW Map</b> in the <b>Modifier</b> tab next to the <b>Create</b>
			tab.&nbsp; There you can mess with positioning it.&nbsp;</p>

			Now that you have the basics (or already did) of creating and moving around 
			shapes in 3DS Max, let's get on to what you want to know, <b>animation</b>!&nbsp; 
			Let me explain again on how this type of animation works.&nbsp; We aren't doing 
			bone animation, just key frame object animation.&nbsp; If you wanted to 
			animation an object going from one place to another in a straight line or along 
			a curve, you don't want to move the object <b>every </b>frame for say 60 frames 
			do you?&nbsp; With key frames, you can just give the object a start and end 
			location and have the rest done for you.&nbsp; If you want it to move along a 
			curve, just position the object at variables points along that curve and it 
			will interpolate the rest for you.&nbsp; The more key frames though, the better 
			the accuracy the animation.&nbsp; So, let's try to do a simple animation.&nbsp; 
			We will attempt to move our cube that we made from one position to another, say 
			(0, 0, 0) to (10, 10, 0), assuming Z is up.&nbsp; Since our object is already 
			at (0, 0, 0) we just need to set a key frame for (10, 10, 0).&nbsp; To do this, 
			click on the <b>Animate</b> button <img border="0" src="images/AnimateButton.jpg" width="48" height="44">.&nbsp; 
			This will turn <font color="#ff0000">red</font>, along with the view port that 
			is selected.&nbsp; Ours happens to be the perspective view port.&nbsp; Now we 
			are ready to set key frames.&nbsp; The first frame (<b>0</b>) just happens to 
			set a key frame by default.&nbsp; Notice the <b>animation bar</b> <img border="0" src="images/AnimationBar.jpg" width="157" height="16">.&nbsp; 
			It says that we are on frame <b>0</b> with <b>100</b> frames total in the 
			animation.&nbsp; This is the default that 3DS Max gives us.&nbsp; You can click 
			and drag the animation bar left and right to scroll through the different 
			frames.&nbsp; You will notice that the frames currently are all the same 
			because we haven't done any animation yet.&nbsp; Let's leave the animation 
			frames to 100 for now, and I will show you later how to change them.&nbsp; 
			Scroll the animation bar to the very last frame <b>100</b>.&nbsp; Now, with the <b>Animate</b>
			button still selected move the box to (10, 10, 0) by right clicking on the <b>Translate
			</b>button and manually typing in (10, 10, 0).&nbsp; You can also move it there 
			yourself if you want to by clicking and dragging the box there.&nbsp; Now, 
			that's all you need to do to set the key frame.&nbsp; With the Animate button 
			set, it remembers what the position, scale and rotation the object has for 
			every frame you go to and change.&nbsp; If you want to view your animation 
			click the <b>Play </b>button <img border="0" src="images/PlayButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">
			or use the <b>Animation</b> bar to scroll through every frame by dragging it 
			left and right.&nbsp; To stop the animation, click the <b>Play </b>button again 
			(It will turn to a stop symbol).&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp; You just did your first 
			key frame animation.&nbsp; Now try going to frame 50 and moving the box to 
			another play.&nbsp; Make sure you have the <b>Animate </b>button down or else 
			it won't compute your changes for the animation.&nbsp; You will notice now that 
			if you move the box in a different place that doesn't move in a straight line 
			there is a curve to it's movement.&nbsp; Try doing some key frames using the 
			Scale and Rotation buttons.&nbsp; If you want to move the object somewhere and 
			then have it interpolate back, just set the first and last frame with the same 
			translation values.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/MarchManBody.jpg" align="left" width="320" height="240"></p>
		<p>Now that we have the basics of doing key frames, let make a simple animation 
			that could load into our program.&nbsp; We will make a simple character that 
			has a basic walk cycle.&nbsp; It might look like Frankenstein but it will prove 
			as an easy example anyone can do.&nbsp; We start with the body.&nbsp; First, 
			create a <b>Cylinder</b> with a <b>Radius</b> of <b>6</b> and <b>Height</b> of <b>20</b>.&nbsp; 
			You can find the <b>Cylinder</b> button 2 below the <b>Box</b> button in the <b>Create</b>
			tab (See <b>Basics </b>above).&nbsp; Leave the rest of the data for the 
			cylinder default.&nbsp; Next, translate the object to (0, 0, 20).&nbsp; Open 
			the <b>Material Editor </b>(hit '<b>m</b>') and give the body a light blue 
			color.&nbsp; Your scene should look something like&nbsp; <b>Figure 2.1</b></p>
		<p><br>
			<img border="0" src="images/MarchManHead.jpg" align="right" width="320" height="240"><b>Figure 
				2.1<br>
				<br>
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>Next, we want to create the head. Create a cone with <b>Radius 1: 6</b>, <b>Radius 
				2: 4</b> and a <b>Height</b> of <b>8</b>.&nbsp; The <b>Cone</b> button can 
			be found on the right of the <b>Box </b>button.&nbsp; Translate the head to (0, 
			0, 42).&nbsp; It should now be positioned a bit above the body.&nbsp; Once 
			again, open the Material Editor and select the skin color material.&nbsp; Drag 
			it onto the head to apply it.&nbsp; You can find this color if you scroll all 
			the way to the right and down about half way.&nbsp; Your scene should look 
			something like <b>Figure 2.2.</b></p>
		<p align="right"><b>Figure 2.2</b></p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/MarchManArms.jpg" align="left" width="320" height="240"></p>
		<p>Now we need to add the arms to our character.&nbsp; Create another cylinder with 
			a <b>Radius</b> of <b>2.5 </b>and a <b>Height</b> of <b>20</b>.&nbsp; <b>Translate</b>
			the arm to <b>(9, 0, 20)</b>.&nbsp; There should be an arm on the character 
			now.&nbsp; We need to create another, but we don't have to create a new 
			cylinder.&nbsp; Select the arm you just made.&nbsp; Click on the <b>Translate</b>
			button <img border="0" src="images/TranslateButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">.&nbsp; 
			Hold down shift and click and drag the arm to another location and left 
			go.&nbsp; You will notice that it brings up a dialog box that asks if you want 
			to create a copy, instance or reference.&nbsp; Leave it at the default "<b>copy</b>" 
			and hit the <b>OK</b> button.&nbsp; Now we have another arm.&nbsp; Translate 
			that arm to <b>(-9, 0, 20)</b>.&nbsp; Apply the same skin material to the arms 
			are you did to the head.&nbsp; Your character should look something like <b>Figure 
				2.3.</b></p>
		<p><b>Figure 2.3</b></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/MarchManLegs.jpg" align="right" width="320" height="240"></p>
		<p>Last but not least, we need to model the legs.&nbsp; Create another cylinder 
			with a <b>Radius</b> of <b>3.5 </b>and a <b>Height</b> of <b>20</b>.&nbsp; <b>Translate</b>
			the leg to <b>(3.5, 0,20)</b>.&nbsp; There should be a leg on the character 
			now.&nbsp; Copy the other leg the same way you did the other arm and translate 
			it to <b>(-3.5, 0, 0)</b>.&nbsp; Assign a darker blue material to the 
			legs.&nbsp; Now you should be done modeling the character.&nbsp; It should look 
			something like <b>Figure 2.4.&nbsp; </b>Before we start animation the model, we 
			want to set the arm's and leg's<b>&nbsp; </b>pivot points.&nbsp; Since we need 
			to rotate the legs and arms to simulate a walk, if we rotated them around the 
			current pivot point it wouldn't look right.&nbsp; We want them to rotate from 
			the top of the cylinder.&nbsp; Let's discuss how to do that next.</p>
		<p align="right"><br>
			<br>
			<b>Figure 2.4</b></p>
		<p align="right"><br>
			<img border="0" src="images/HierarchyTab.jpg" align="left" width="184" height="318"></p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/PivotPoints.jpg" align="right" width="235" height="318">Select 
			the a leg.&nbsp; Click the <b>Hierarchy</b> <b>Tab</b> on the right of the <b>Modify</b>
			<b>Tab</b>.&nbsp; It should bring up a bunch of options for <b>Pivot</b>, <b>IK</b>
			and <b>Link Info (Figure 2.5)</b>.&nbsp; Click the Affect Pivot Only 
			button.&nbsp; It should turn a different color.&nbsp; This means that what ever 
			we do, be it translations or rotations, it will just effect the pivot point of 
			the object, not the object itself.&nbsp; We want to move the pivot point near 
			the top of the leg so it rotates correctly.&nbsp; Translate the leg's pivot 
			point Z value to 18.&nbsp; Do the same thing for the other leg.&nbsp; Now we'll 
			do the arms.&nbsp; Translate both arm's pivot point Z values to 38.&nbsp; Now 
			the arm's and the leg's pivot points should be near the top of the 
			cylinder.&nbsp; This will allow us to rotate around a more appropriate 
			axis.&nbsp; If you <b>click</b> and <b>drag</b> your mouse over all of the 
			objects to select them and then turn on the <b>Affect Pivot Only</b> button, 
			the pivot points should be in the same position as shown in <b>Figure 2.6</b>.&nbsp; 
			You can unclick the <b>Affect Pivot Only </b>button now.</p>
		<p><b>Figure 2.5</b></p>
		<p align="right"><b>Figure 2.6<br>
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>We are ready to now go on to moving the arms and legs around.&nbsp; The 
			character's walk cycle will be more like a march in place animation.&nbsp; It 
			will be a seamless animation though.&nbsp; To start animation, let's move the <b>Animation 
				Bar</b> to <b>Frame 0</b> if it isn't already.&nbsp; Click the <b>Animate</b>
			button <img border="0" src="images/AnimateButton.jpg" width="48" height="44"> to 
			allow key frames to be set.&nbsp;First we will do the legs.&nbsp; Now that the <b>Animate</b>
			button is set, move the <b>Frame</b> <b>Bar</b> <img border="0" src="images/AnimationBar.jpg" width="157" height="16">
			to frame <b>25</b>.&nbsp; Click on the <b>Rotate </b>button <img border="0" src="images/RotationButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">
			next to the <b>Translate </b>button <img border="0" src="images/TranslateButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">.&nbsp; 
			Select the <b>right</b> leg of the character (his true right leg, our left 
			side).&nbsp; Now, right click on the <b>Rotate </b>button.&nbsp; It should 
			bring up a dialog box similar to the <b>Translate Dialog Box</b>.&nbsp; Look at <b>Figure 
				2.7</b> for the <b>Rotate Dialog Box</b>.
		</p>
		<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/RotateBox.jpg" width="293" height="125"><b>Figure 
				2.7</b></p>
		<p align="left">There should be all <b>0</b>'s in the fields as shown above.&nbsp; 
			Now, we want to rotate the current leg along the X Axis.&nbsp; To do this, we 
			can just type in <b>-45</b> in the <b>Absolute:World X</b> field.&nbsp; Make 
			sure that was set by clicking in another field or pressing enter.&nbsp; Now 
			close the dialog box.&nbsp; You will notice that the characters right leg has 
			lifted off the ground as if to step forward (<b>Figure 2.8</b>).&nbsp; If the 
			rotation did not happen correctly, make sure the pivot point was set 
			right.&nbsp; It should be located near the top of the leg.</p>
		<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/rleganim.jpg" width="320" height="240">
			<b>Figure 2.8</b></p>
		<p align="left">If you scroll the <b>Frame</b> <b>Bar</b> back and forth between 
			frames <b>0</b> to <b>25</b> you should see the leg rise and fall.&nbsp; If you 
			do not see this make sure you have the <b>Animate</b> button selected and your 
			view port should have a <font color="#ff0000"><b>red</b></font> outline to 
			it.&nbsp; Now move the <b>Frame</b> <b>Bar</b> to frame <b>50</b>.&nbsp; Right 
			click again on the <b>Rotate</b> button and set the <b>X</b> rotation back to <b>0</b>
			again.&nbsp; If you move the <b>Frame Bar </b>back and forth now, it should 
			animate the leg moving up and then back down again.<br>
			<br>
			To animate the other leg, we need to do something a tad bit different.&nbsp; 
			Since this character will be doing a march, we want the right leg to go up and 
			come down, then the left leg to go up and come down.&nbsp; That means that we 
			will want to set key frames for the left leg at frame <b>75</b> and at frame <b>100</b>.&nbsp; 
			The problem with this is, if you just set a key frame at <b>75</b> for the left 
			leg, it will interpolate from <b>0</b> to <b>75</b>.&nbsp; We need to set a key 
			frame a <b>0</b> and then <b>50</b> first.&nbsp; To do this, click on the left 
			leg and move the <b>Frame Bar</b> to frame <b>0</b>.&nbsp; Right click on the <b>Frame 
				Bar</b>.&nbsp; A dialog box will pop ups that asks if you want to create a 
			key frame on the current frame.&nbsp; Click <b>OK</b> and you will notice a 
			gray circle appear underneath the <b>Frame Bar</b>.&nbsp; That means that a key 
			frame is set there.&nbsp; Now go to frame <b>50</b> and do the same 
			thing.&nbsp; You should see a gray circle under frame <b>0</b> and frame <b>50</b>.&nbsp; 
			If you go back to the right foot it will also have one of these gray circles 
			for frame <b>25</b> and <b>50</b>.&nbsp; You might be thinking that you should 
			just have to do it at frame <b>50</b>, but when you export the model the way it 
			handles the animation it won't work.&nbsp; It would actually be a good idea to 
			set a key frame at frame <b>0</b> like this for every object that you 
			manipulate just to make sure.<br>
			<br>
			So, once you set the key frame for the <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> at frame <b>50</b>, 
			go to frame <b>75</b>.&nbsp; Do the same rotation that you did for the right 
			foot (<b>-45</b> degrees along the <b>X</b> axis).&nbsp; Next, move the <b>Frame 
				Bar</b> to the very last frame, <b>100</b>.&nbsp; Rotate the left leg back 
			to it's original position by setting the <b>X</b> axis rotation from <b>-45</b> 
			to <b>0</b> again.&nbsp; Press the <b>Play</b> button&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/PlayButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">
			to view the animation or move the <b>Frame Bar</b> back and forth.&nbsp; The 
			character should appear to be doing a march, with the right foot forward, down, 
			then the left foot forward, then down.&nbsp; Remember to make sure you have the 
			Animate button down while you are setting the key frames or else it will not 
			work.</p>
		<p align="center">Simple animation huh?&nbsp; Well let's make it a bit more life 
			like and move his arms.&nbsp; Select the character's <b>right</b> arm.&nbsp; Go 
			to frame <b>25</b>.&nbsp; Rotate the arm by <b>45</b> degrees along the <b>X</b>
			axis.&nbsp; The arm should now be rotating backwards if you want the 
			animation.&nbsp; Make sure it looks similar to <b>Figure 2.9</b>.<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="images/rarmanim.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <b>Figure 2.9</b></p>
		<p align="left"><br>
			Now go to frame <b>75</b>.&nbsp; Rotate the arm by <b>-45</b> degrees on the <b>X</b>
			axis.&nbsp; Lastly, go to frame <b>100</b> and set the rotation to 0.&nbsp; The 
			arm should now be resting at the character's side.&nbsp; If you want the other 
			arm to move, select the <b>left</b> arm and do the same thing but do the 
			opposite rotations.&nbsp; First rotate by <b>-45</b> degrees along the <b>X </b>
			at frame <b>25</b>, and then at frame <b>75</b> rotate it by <b>45</b> degrees 
			along the<b> X</b>.&nbsp; Finally, at frame <b>100</b> set it back to <b>0</b> for 
			the <b>X</b>.&nbsp; If you press play now you should have a character doing a 
			simple march animation with his arms going back and forth.&nbsp; If you go to 
			frame <b>75</b> your character should look like <b>Figure 2.10</b>.</p>

			<b>Figure 2.10</b></p>
		<p align="left"><br>
			That's it!&nbsp; That is how you do a simple character animation using key 
			frames.&nbsp; See if you can get the head to bounce while he marches.&nbsp; I 
			dare ya.&nbsp;
			<br>
			<br>
			Once you have the animation the way you want it, turn <b>off</b> the <b>Animate</b>
			button and move the <b>Frame Bar</b> to frame <b>0</b>.&nbsp; Go to the <b>File </b>
			menu and choose <b>Export..., </b>Then obviously save it as a <b>.3ds </b>file.&nbsp; 
			That should be good enough for you to load it into your program and use our key 
			frame animation tutorial to play the animation back.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<P align="left">If you want to change the amount of frames your animation is, 
			instead of the default 100, Right Click on the Key Mode Toggle button<img border="0" src="images/KeyModeButton.jpg" width="25" height="25">.&nbsp; 
			A dialog box will pop up with options to change the frames per second speed, as 
			well as many other options.&nbsp; They are pretty self explanatory.&nbsp; A 
			good frame size is 60.<br>
			<br>
			In closing, I would like to say that there may a few things you have to mess 
			around with to get the animation working correctly.&nbsp; There has not been 
			extensive testing on the animation loader so there may be some times it might 
			do something funny.&nbsp; It is not intended to be a robust animation loader 
			but to teach the basics of doing simple key frame animation from 3D Studio
