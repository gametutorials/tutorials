// This file includes all of the class definitions for CLoadMD3 and CModelMD3.
// Get ready for some intense code.  There is a lot to look through that might
// discourage you from loading MD3 models, but it's not so bad once you get
// started.  Hopefully I can explain this well enough that you won't be
// intimidated by it.
//
// Let me describe what these classes are for.  CModelMD3 is the class the 
// client (you) uses to load and draw the character.  CLoadMD3 is what the
// CModelMD3 class uses to load the character mesh information.  It is nearly
// identical to the CLoadMD2 class that we implemented in the MD2 Loader tutorial.
//
// Also, like in that tutorial, we convert the Quake3 structures to our own t3DModel
// format that we use in the other loader tutorials, give or take a few variables.
// Once again, I want to keep all the loader tutorials using the same structure so
// there isn't more code to get lost in, which you are unfamiliar with.  Another
// reason for this is that this is a perfect opportunity to create an abstract
// base class for a C3DModel (or perhaps CModel3D) object.  This will allow each
// file loader to have their own inherited class.  This is a great design which will
// enable us to pass in any type of 3D object into functions that deal with objects,
// no matter what file format they are loaded from.
//
// You'll notice that we have a stray function for checking sub-strings, IsInString().
// We use this when we load the skin.  Don't worry about it.  It just returns true
// if the strSubString is inside of the original string, strString.  That way we don't
// have to parse the whole skin texture file line to look for the tag.
//
// Let's get to the code.  Be sure to look down at the Quick Notes near the bottom
// of this file for a overview of what this code all does.  It is assumed that you have
// read the introduction to .md3 loading at the top of Main.cpp
//

	// grab the starting index where the sub string is in the original string
	unsigned int index = (int)strString.find(strSubString);

	// Make sure the index returned was valid

	// the forearm.  That is what is meant by linking.  That way, when we rotate the

	// as the arm's parent node, and the rest are children that are subject to move to where
	// ever the top part of the arm goes.  That is how bone/skeletal animation works.

	// So, we have an array of tags that have a position, rotation and name.  If we want

	// pLinks array.  This is an array of pointers to hold the address of the linked model.
	// Quake3 models are set up in a weird way, but usually you would just forget about a
	// separate array for links, you would just have a pointer to a t3DModel in the tag

	// so we need to compensate for this.  Usually I would just switch the
	// z and y values when loading in the vertices, but the rotations that
	// are stored in the tags (joint info) are a matrix, which makes it hard
	// to change those to reflect Y up.  I didn't want to mess with that so
	// this 1 rotate will fix this problem.

	// we are doing a bone/joint animation... and the models need to be linked together,
	// we can't do that.  It totally would ignore the tags.  Instead, we start at the

	// the legs linked tags (just the upper body) and then it with the tag's rotation
	// and translation values.  I ignored the rotation in this tutorial since we aren't
	// doing any animation.  I didn't want to overwhelm you with quaternions just yet :)
	// Normally in skeletal animation, the root body part is the hip area.  Then the legs
	// bones are created as children to the torso.  The upper body is also a child to
	// the torso.  Since the legs are one whole mesh, this works out somewhat the same way.  
	// This wouldn't work if the feet and legs weren't connected in the same mesh because
	// the feet rotations and positioning don't directly effect the position and rotation
	// of the upper body, the hips do.  If that makes sense...  That is why the root starts

	// legs did a back flipped and landed on the floor.  Of course, this would look really
	// stupid.  A 270-degree rotation to the rest of the body is done for that animation.
	// Keep in mind, the legs mesh is NEVER translated or rotated.  It only rotates and
	// translates the upper parts of the body.  All the rotation and translation of the
	// legs is done in the canned animation that was created in the modeling program.

//
// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// I hope you didn't throw up when you saw all the code :)  It is a beast to start out,
// but you should try writing it from scratch! :)  And besides, when doing character
// animation, you should expect it to be huge because this is some pretty advanced stuff.
// Since this is proprietary, all we have to work on is the file format.  If you find 
// anything wrong or just plain stupid, let me know and I will make the fix so others 
// don't have to suffer in ignorance like myself :)  Let's go over the whole shebang:
// 
// The first thing you have to understand about characters in Quake3 is that the model
// is split into multiple files.  There is a upper.md3, a head.md3 and a lower.md3.
// These hold the upper body, the head and legs models.
//
// Below, like at the bottom of main.cpp, is the explanation of how this stuff works:
// 
// Speaking of animation, so how does this stuff all work?  Is it bone animation or isn't it?
// Well, yes and no.  First, yes, there is bone animation because the legs are the parent
// node, and then the upper body attaches to the legs, then the head attaches to the upper 
// body.  Wherever the legs move, the upper body is then
// translated and rotated to the correct position that it should be, and then the head
// is in the same matrix scope so it goes where the upper body goes.  Once again, we do not
// handle rotating in this tutorial.  That requires a ton of matrix code that will be used
// in the next animation tutorial with quaternions (The room goes silent.....).
//
// And as for the second point, no the animation isn't exactly bone animation.  Each
// animation is stored in vertex key frames, just like the .MD2 files were.  The only
// difference is that we have 3 body parts to keep track of.  That way it is more realistic
// in the way of, you can have your character doing something totally different with their legs,
// than what the top part of them is doing.  Such as, when you are doing the jumping animation,
// the upper body could be doing a shooting, picking up, or dropping animation.  Make sense?
// So to the question of if this is bone animation, I can say a firm!!!..... Yes/No :)
//
// The .md3 files have skins and shader files associated with them.  It has a skin if it's
// a body part and a shader file if it's a weapon model.  These files store, for the most
// part, the textures associated with each model.  Sometimes the model has multiple textures,
// one for each sub-object.  I left the skin files the same, but I deleted a lot of the
// garbage that we didn't need in the .shader file.  Look at LoaderShader() for more info.
//
// There is also a config (.cfg) file for the animations of the model.  This stores the
// first frame, the amount of frames for that animation, the looping frame count (not used),
// and the frames per second that that animation should run.  We don't do anything with this
// file in this tutorial, but in the next tutorial we will.
//
// Finally, this brings us to the most confusing part in the .md3 model format, the tags.
// What the heck are tags?  Tags can be thought of as joints.  If you look in the .skin files
// you will see the tags on a separate line.  These are basically
// joints that we need to connect other models too.  These are the ones I have seen:
//
// tag_torso  - The joint that connects the hips and the upper body together
// tag_head   - The joing that connects the neck and the head model too
// tag_weapon - The tag that connects the hand of the upper body and the weapon too.
//
// Now, that's the easy part to understand... it's like the velcro that each body part
// sticks to right?  Well, the next part is where the confusion comes in.  Besides being
// a joint it stores the bone rotations and translations that need to be applied to the
// model that is connected to that joint.  For instance, we never rotate or translate the
// lower.md3 model.  That is all taken care of in the vertex key frame animation, but, the
// model stores tags for the "tag_torso" joint, which tells the upper body where to move and
// rotate, depending on what the legs are doing.
//
// A good example of this is in the back flip animation.  The legs animation has key frames that
// it interpolates to, to perform this back flip, but the rest of the model doesn't.  To
// compensate for that, each frame, the lower body model sends a message to the upper body
// model to move and rotate to a certain degree and position, along a certain axis.  In
// programming terms, this means that we push on a new matrix and then apply some translations
// and rotations to the rest of the body parts (upper, head and weapon parts).  You don't
// directly apply it to each one, you just push on a matrix, apply the rotations and 
// translations, then anything drawn after that will be apart of that new matrix.  Simple huh?
// The rotation is stored in a 3x3 rotation matrix.  That is why we didn't bother with it
// in this tutorial because there is no animation so no need to add more code to scare you away.
// The translation is a simple (x, y, z) position that can be easily passed in to glTranslatef().
// This can all be seen in DrawLink().  In the next tutorial, we will not use glTranslatef(),
// but we will just include the translation in our matrix that we create to rotate the model.
// Then we can just do a simple call to glMultMatrix() to do both the rotation and translation
// at the same time.
//
// As a final explanation about the tags, let me address the model linking.  This just
// attaches 2 models together at the desired tag (or joint). For example, we attach the
// the upper.md3 model to the lower.md3 model at the "tag_torso" joint.  Now, when ever
// the legs do their animation, it sends the translation and rotation messages to all of
// it's children, which in this case, is just the upper body model, which effects the
// upper body's children (The weapon and head models).  The link array has nothing to do
// with the file format being loaded in.  That is just the way that I chose to handle it.
// You can also find some code on www.planetquake.com by Lonerunner.  This guy/gal is awesome!
// He has a ton of 3D game formats that he did, which can be found at Romka's site too.  
//
// That is pretty much the crux of the .MD3 loading.  There is some bone animation to be
// loaded, but I never really figured it out.  The position was always (0, 0, 0) so I don't
// know what those were for.  I was going to display the bones, but it doesn't seem to save
// the position.  Who knows... if you know how, let me know.  Maybe I am ignoring something.
// It has min/max values, but I didn't bother to try and figure it out.
// 
// I would like to point out, this is just the solution I came up with.  There is probably
// a lot more intelligent ways to handle this, but it works great for me.  When the Quake3
// source code comes out, maybe we will all learn a few things from the mast'ehr :)
