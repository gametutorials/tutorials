//
// This version of the tutorial incorporates the animation data stored in the MD3
// character files.  We will be reading in the .cfg file that stores the animation
// data.  The rotations and translations of the models will be done using a matrix.
// There will be no more calls to glTranslatef().  To create the rotation and
// translation matrix, quaternions will be used.  This is because quaternions
// are excellent for interpolating between 2 rotations, as well as not overriding
// another translation causing "gimbal lock".
// 
// So, why do we need to interpolate?  Well, the animations for the character are
// stored in key frames.  Instead of saving each frame of an animation, key frames
// are stored to cut down on memory and disk space.  The files would be huge if every
// frame was saved for every animation, as well as creating a huge memory footprint.  
// Can you imagine having 10+ models in memory with all of that animation data?  
// 
// The animation key frames are stored in 2 ways.  The torso and legs mesh have vertices
// stored for each of the key frames, along with separate rotations and translations
// for the basic bone animation.  Remember, that each .md3 represents a bone, that needs
// to be connected at a joint.  For instance, the torso is connected to the legs, and the
// head is connected to the torso.  So, that makes 3 bones and 2 joints.  If you add the
// weapon, the weapon is connected to the hand joint, which gives us 4 bones and 3 joints.
// Unlike conventional skeletal animation systems, the main animations of the character's
// movement, such as a gesture or swimming animation, are done not with bones, but with 
// vertex key frames, like in the .md2 format. Since the lower, upper, head and weapon models
// are totally different models, which aren't seamlessly connected to each other, the parent
// node needs to end a message (a translation and rotation) down to all it's child nodes to
// tell them where they need to be in order for the animation to look right.  A good example
// of this is when the legs have the back flip animation.  The legs might kick back into a back
// flip that lands the character on their feet.  Well, since the main models are separate,
// if the legs didn't tell the torso where to go, then the model's torso would stay in the same
// place and the body would detach itself from the legs.  The exporter calculates all this stuff
// for you of course.
// 
// But getting back to the interpolation, since we use key frames, if we didn't interpolate
// between them, the animation would look very jumpy and unnatural.  It would also go too
// fast.  By interpolating, we create a smooth transition between each key frame.
//
// As seen in the .md2 tutorials, interpolating between vertices is easy if we use the
// linear interpolation function:  p(t) = p0 + t(p1 - p0).  The same goes for translations,
// since it's just 2 3D points.  This is not so for the rotations.  The Quake3 character
// stores the rotations for each key frame in a 3x3 matrix.  This isn't a simple linear
// interpolation that needs to be performed.  If we convert the matrices to a quaternion,  
// then use spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) between the current frame's quaternion 
// and the next key frame's quaternion, we will have a new interpolated quaternion that
// can be converted into a 4x4 matrix to be applied to the current model view matrix in OpenGL.
// After finding the interpolated translation to be applied, we can slip that into the rotation
// matrix before it's applied to the current matrix, which will require only one matrix command.
//
// You'll notice that in the CreateFromMatrix() function in our quaternion class, I allow a
// row and column count to be passed in.  This is just a dirty way to allow a 3x3 or 4x4 matrix
// to be passed in.  Instead of creating a whole new function and copy and pasting the main 
// code, it seemed fitting for a tutorial.  It's obvious that the quaternion class is missing
// a tremendous amount of functions, but I chose to only keep the functions that we would use.
// 
// For those of you who don't know what interpolation us, here is a section abstracted 
// from the MD2 Animation tutorial:
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Interpolation: Gamedev.net's Game Dictionary say interpolation is "using a ratio 
// to step gradually a variable from one value to another."  In our case, this
// means that we gradually move our vertices from one key frame to another key frame.
// There are many types of interpolation, but we are just going to use linear.
// The equation for linear interpolation is this:
//
//				p(t) = p0 + t(p1 - p0)
//
//				t - The current time with 0 being the start and 1 being the end
//				p(t) - The result of the equation with time t
//				p0 - The starting position
//				p1 - The ending position
//
// Let's throw in an example with numbers to test this equation.  If we have
// a vertex stored at 0 along the X axis and we wanted to move the point to
// 10 with 5 steps, see if you can fill in the equation without a time just yet.
//
// Finished?  You should have come up with:
//
//				p(t) = 0 + t(10 - 0)
//				p(t) = 0 + 10t
//				p(t) = 10t
//
// Now, all we need it a time from 0 to 1 to pass in, which will allow us to find any
// point from 0 to 10, depending on the time.  Since we wanted to find out the distance
// we need to travel each frame if we want to reach the end point in 5 steps, we just
// divide 1 by 5: 1/5 = 0.2
//
// We can then pass this into our equation:
//
//				p(0.2) = 10 * 0.2
//				p(0.2) = 2
//
// What does that tell us?  It tells us we need to move the vertex along the x
// axis each frame by a distance of 2 to reach 10 in 5 steps.  Yah, yah, this isn't
// rocket science, but it's important to know that what your mind would have done
// immediately without thinking about it, is linear interpolation.  
//
// Are you starting to see how this applies to our model?  If we only read in key
// frames, then we need to interpolate every vertex between the current and next
// key frame for animation.  To get a perfect idea of what is going on, try
// taking out the interpolation and just render the key frames.  You will notice
// that you can still see what is kinda going on, but it moves at an incredible pace!
// There is not smoothness, just a really fast jumpy animation.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Let's jump into the code (hold your breath!)

{
	// Create a local quaternion to store the interpolated quaternion
	CQuaternion qInterpolated;

	// This function is the milk and honey of our quaternion code, the rest of
	// the functions are an appendage to what is done here.  Everyone understands
	// the terms, "matrix to quaternion", "quaternion to matrix", "create quaternion matrix",
	// "quaternion multiplication", etc.. but "SLERP" is the stumbling block, even a little 
	// bit after hearing what it stands for, "Spherical Linear Interpolation".  What that
	// means is that we have 2 quaternions (or rotations) and we want to interpolate between 
	// them.  The reason what it's called "spherical" is that quaternions deal with a sphere.  
	// Linear interpolation just deals with 2 points primarily, where when dealing with angles
	// and rotations, we need to use sin() and cos() for interpolation.  If we wanted to use
	// quaternions for camera rotations, which have much more instant and jerky changes in 
	// rotations, we would use Spherical-Cubic Interpolation.  The equation for SLERP is this:
	//
	// q = (((b.a)^-1)^t)a
	//
	// Go here for an a detailed explanation and proofs of this equation:
	//
	// http://www.magic-software.com/Documentation/quat.pdf
	//
	// Now, Let's code it

	// Here we do a check to make sure the 2 quaternions aren't the same, return q1 if they are
	if(q1.x == q2.x && q1.y == q2.y && q1.z == q2.z && q1.w == q2.w) 
		return q1;

	// Following the (b.a) part of the equation, we do a dot product between q1 and q2.
	// We can do a dot product because the same math applied for a 3D vector as a 4D vector.
	float result = (q1.x * q2.x) + (q1.y * q2.y) + (q1.z * q2.z) + (q1.w * q2.w);

	// If the dot product is less than 0, the angle is greater than 90 degrees
	if(result < 0.0f)
	{
		// Negate the second quaternion and the result of the dot product
		q2 = CQuaternion(-q2.x, -q2.y, -q2.z, -q2.w);
		result = -result;
	}

	// Set the first and second scale for the interpolation
	float scale0 = 1 - t, scale1 = t;

	// Next, we want to actually calculate the spherical interpolation.  Since this
	// calculation is quite computationally expensive, we want to only perform it
	// if the angle between the 2 quaternions is large enough to warrant it.  If the
	// angle is fairly small, we can actually just do a simpler linear interpolation
	// of the 2 quaternions, and skip all the complex math.  We create a "delta" value
	// of 0.1 to say that if the cosine of the angle (result of the dot product) between
	// the 2 quaternions is smaller than 0.1, then we do NOT want to perform the full on 
	// interpolation using.  This is because you won't really notice the difference.

	// Check if the angle between the 2 quaternions was big enough to warrant such calculations
	if(1 - result > 0.1f)
	{
		// Get the angle between the 2 quaternions, and then store the sin() of that angle
		float theta = (float)acos(result);
		float sinTheta = (float)sin(theta);

		// Calculate the scale for q1 and q2, according to the angle and it's sine value
		scale0 = (float)sin( ( 1 - t ) * theta) / sinTheta;
		scale1 = (float)sin( ( t * theta) ) / sinTheta;
	}	

	// Calculate the x, y, z and w values for the quaternion by using a special
	// form of linear interpolation for quaternions.
	qInterpolated.x = (scale0 * q1.x) + (scale1 * q2.x);

//
// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// 
// Below I will sum up everything that we went over in this tutorial.  I don't 
// think it was a ton of things to sift through, but certainly model loading and
// animation are huge subjects that need a lot of code.  You can't just call
// glLoadModel() and glAnimateModel() for this stuff :)
// 
// First of all, we added a basic quaternion class to our tutorial.  This is used
// to take a matrix, convert it to a quaternion, interpolate between another 
// quaternion that was converted to a matrix, then turned back into a matrix.
// This is because quaternions are a great way to interpolate between rotations.
// If you wanted to use the glRotatef() and glTranslatef() functions, you would
// want to convert the interpolated quaternion to an axis angle representation,
// which might be less code, but not as useful in the long run.
// 
// The next important thing that was added was the interpolation between vertex
// key frames.  We learned earlier (top of Md3.cpp) that not most of the animation
// is done through key frame vertices, not bones.  The only bone animation that is
// done is with the joints that connect the .md3 models together.  The game Half-Life, 
// for example, uses a full on skeletal animation.
// 
// Also, in this tutorial we added the code to parse the animation config file (.cfg).
// This stores the animation information for each animation.  The order of them are
// important.  For the most part, the config files are the same format.  As discussed
// in the previous MD3 tutorial, there is a few extra things in the config file that
// we don't read in here, such as footstep sounds and initial positions.  The tutorial
// was not designed to be a robust reusable Quake3 character loader, but to teach you
// how it works for the most part.  Other things are extra credit :)
//
// Another important thing was our timing system.  Since we were dealing with multiple
// models that had different frames per second, we needed to add some variables to our
// t3DModel class to hold some things like elapsedTime and the current t value.  This
// way, no static variables had to be created, like in the .MD2 tutorial.
// 
// Let me know if this helps you out!
