	// sphere collided with it.  If it did, we don't stop there.  We can have 
	// multiple collisions so it's important to check them all.  One a collision

			// Since we have a bulky sphere for our camera, it makes it so that we have to 
			// go an extra distance to pass around a corner. This is because the edges of 
			// the polygons are colliding with our peripheral view (the sides of the sphere).  
			// So it looks likes we should be able to go forward, but we are stuck and considered 
			// to be colliding.  To fix this, we just pass in the radius / 2.  Remember, this
			// is only for the check of the polygon's edges.  It just makes it look a bit more
			// realistic when colliding around corners.  Ideally, if we were using bounding box
