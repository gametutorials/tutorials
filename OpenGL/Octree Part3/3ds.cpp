// This file handles all of the code needed to load a .3DS file.
// Basically, how it works is, you load a chunk, then you check
// the chunk ID.  Depending on the chunk ID, you load the information
// that is stored in that chunk.  If you do not want to read that information,
// you read past it.  You know how many bytes to read past the chunk because
// every chunk stores the length in bytes of that chunk.

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// This was a HUGE amount of knowledge and probably the largest tutorial yet!
// In the next tutorial we will show you how to load a text file format called .obj.
// This is the most common 3D file format that almost ANY 3D software will import.
//
// Once again I should point out that the coordinate system of OpenGL and 3DS Max are different.
// Since 3D Studio Max Models with the Z-Axis pointing up (strange and ugly I know! :), 
// we need to flip the y values with the z values in our vertices.  That way it
// will be normal, with Y pointing up.  Also, because we swap the Y and Z we need to negate 
// the Z to make it come out correctly.  This is also explained and done in ReadVertices().
//
// CHUNKS: What is a chunk anyway?
// 
// "The chunk ID is a unique code which identifies the type of data in this chunk 
// and also may indicate the existence of subordinate chunks. The chunk length indicates 
// the length of following data to be associated with this chunk. Note, this may 
// contain more data than just this chunk. If the length of data is greater than that 
// needed to fill in the information for the chunk, additional subordinate chunks are 
// attached to this chunk immediately following any data needed for this chunk, and 
// should be parsed out. These subordinate chunks may themselves contain subordinate chunks. 
// Unfortunately, there is no indication of the length of data, which is owned by the current 
// chunk, only the total length of data attached to the chunk, which means that the only way 
// to parse out subordinate chunks is to know the exact format of the owning chunk. On the 
// other hand, if a chunk is unknown, the parsing program can skip the entire chunk and 
// subordinate chunks in one jump. " - Jeff Lewis (werewolf@worldgate.com)
//
// In a short amount of words, a chunk is defined this way:
// 2 bytes - Stores the chunk ID (OBJECT, MATERIAL, PRIMARY, etc...)
// 4 bytes - Stores the length of that chunk.  That way you know when that
//           chunk is done and there is a new chunk.
//
// So, to start reading the 3DS file, you read the first 2 bytes of it, then
// the length (using fread()).  It should be the PRIMARY chunk, otherwise it isn't
// a .3DS file.  
//
// Below is a list of the order that you will find the chunks and all the know chunks.
// If you go to www.wosit.org you can find a few documents on the 3DS file format.
// You can also take a look at the 3DS Format.rtf that is included with this tutorial.

// Once you know how to read chunks, all you have to know is the ID you are looking for
// and what data is stored after that ID.  You need to get the file format for that.
// I can give it to you if you want, or you can go to www.wosit.org for several versions.
// Because this is a proprietary format, it isn't a official document.
//
// I know there was a LOT of information blown over, but it is too much knowledge for
// one tutorial.  In the animation tutorial that I eventually will get to, some of
// the things explained here will be explained in more detail.  I do not claim that
// this is the best .3DS tutorial, or even a GOOD one :)  But it is a good start, and there
// isn't much code out there that is simple when it comes to reading .3DS files.
// So far, this is the best I have seen.  That is why I made it :)
// 
// I would like to thank www.wosit.org and Terry Caton (tcaton@umr.edu) for his help on this.
//
// Let me know if this helps you out!
